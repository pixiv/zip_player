== Introduction ==

zip_player is a JavaScript library to load and play back animated images
packaged as an uncompressed ZIP archive containing individual frames.
Frames are drawn onto a Canvas element and may be any image MIME type
supported by the browser (e.g. JPEG, PNG, GIF - though animated GIFs are not
supported for obvious reasons).

It also supports an unpacked mode where the images are directly referenced as
individual URLs (e.g. data: URLs for client-side preview purposes).

== Dependencies ==

jQuery (zip_player uses jQuery for event dispatch).

== Usage ==

Open test/index.html for an example. Note that you need to serve it from a web
server with Range support for zip mode to work (unpacked mode does not require
Range support).

== Browser compatibility ==

- Any recent Chrome or Firefox
- Safari 7+
- IE 10+
- iOS 5+ (6+ recommended, 5 is slow due to lack of Blob URL support)
- Android browser 4.0+

== Testing ==

To run the tests manually, open test/test.html under a web browser. You need to
serve it from a web server with Range support. The test suite uses mocha.js.

To run the automated test suite, you need Node, PhantomJS, and the following
dependencies:

$ npm install -g connect mocha-phantomjs

Run test/test.sh to run the automated test suite. It will automatically start
a test web server, run the tests, and shut down the server. You may need to edit
test/test.sh for your particular system's installation paths.
